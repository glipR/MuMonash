# Excluding equality you can solve this with knapsack in 10^8 comp.
# let weight of knapsack be half of the value to enemy, minus 1.
# let value of items in knapsack be value to you.
# maximum knapsack is your spoils.
# Unsure how to fix for equal case, because DP doesn't work if we try to get close to half.
